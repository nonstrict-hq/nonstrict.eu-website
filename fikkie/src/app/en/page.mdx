## The idea {{ date: '2025-01-15T00:00Z' }}

Lighting a fire is cozy, but ideally when the smoke won't linger. Better for you, better for your neighbors, better for the air. Some municipalities even enforce this: only burn when it's code yellow.

RIVM has the [Stookwijzer](https://www.stookwijzer.nu) for that, and it does the job. But wouldn't it be nice if it were a bit more accessible? A fast native app that grabs your location and shows you at a glance: can you or not? No opening a website, no entering a postal code, just the answer.

As someone who builds apps all day, this felt like something that needed to exist. So I started working on it. I'm starting with a simple version showing just the advice for your location, and then we'll see where it goes from there.
