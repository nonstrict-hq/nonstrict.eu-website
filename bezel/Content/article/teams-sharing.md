Demonstrating your iPhone or iPad screen during a Microsoft Teams meeting is an excellent way to share your experience or present your work. With the Bezel app on your Mac, you can mirror your iPhone screen directly in the meeting without needing to join from your iPhone. Here's a quick guide to do it in three steps.

## 1. Get the Bezel App for Free

Bezel is a fully native Mac app created for mirroring your iPhone screen. It's user-friendly and easy to install, making it accessible for everyone. Download the app on your Mac:

## 2. Start Mirroring Your iPhone

Launch the Bezel app by clicking its icon and connect your iPhone with a USB cable. Your iPhone screen will now be mirrored on your Mac:

## 3. Join the Teams Meeting

Join the Teams meeting as you normally would on your Mac. Click the "Share" button at the bottom of the screen and select the mirrored iPhone window or share the entire display showing the iPhone screen.

Connect your iPhone and choose the new window to share in Teams. It's that simple to get a perfect mirror of your iPhone, complete with the device frame!
