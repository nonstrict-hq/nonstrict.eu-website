## Step 2: Connect Your iPhone

Open the Bezel app and connect your iPhone or iPad to your Mac using a USB cable. Once connected, your device will be displayed on your Mac screen.

The first time you launch Bezel, it will guide you through the trust process so the iPhone and Mac can connect to each other.

## All Set

You've learned how to use Bezel to display your iPhone or iPad screen on Zoom. It is simple and enhances your meeting experience. With a few clicks, you can share apps, demonstrate iOS features, or display photos and videos directly from your device. All looking great with a neat device frame around it giving people context. 

There is however also an alternative available in Zoom by default. The "Share Screen" dialog in Zoom also has an option to share your iPhone or iPad, either wireless or with a cable. This option doesn't show a device frame around the screen share, and doesn't help you setup the connection, but can be a good alternative for users on older Macs.
