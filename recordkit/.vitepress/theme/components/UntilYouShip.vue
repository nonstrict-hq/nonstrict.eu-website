      An <strong class="evil">endless</strong> list of edge cases caused by different and exotic end-user setups will come your way. Trust us, we've been there — and many with us.

    <ul>
      <li>💸 <strong class="evil">Costly</strong> — fixing edge cases takes months of engineering.</li>
      <li>🤬 <strong class="evil">UX impact</strong> — in the meantime, your users suffer from bugs.</li>
      <li>🐌 <strong class="evil">Slowdown</strong> — bug-fixing instead of shipping valuable features.</li>
    </ul>
