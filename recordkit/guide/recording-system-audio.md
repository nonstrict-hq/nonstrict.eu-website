## Recording All System Audio

Setup a recorder as usual and add the `systemAudio` item to record all system audio. Here's an example:

```swift{3}
// Configure the recorder
let recorder = RKRecorder(schema: RKRecorderSchema(items: [
        .systemAudio()
    ])) { _ in }

// The recorder is now ready to use:
try await recorder.prepare() // Warm up devices & check permissions
recorder.start() // Capturing starts
try await Task.sleep(.seconds(10)) // Record for some time
let result = try await recorder.stop() // Finish the recording
print(result) // Information about the recording
```

::: tip üíÅ Some apps are not recorded by default
Audio from your own process as well as audio from apps that are known to loop audio, like Rogue Amoeba Loopback and R√òDE audio software, are excluded from the recording by default.

If you do need to record those apps, pass your own exclude options to `systemAudio`.

üöß Support for excluding a specific app from the recording will be added to a future version of RecordKit.

## Recording a Single App

üöß Support for recording a single app will be added to a future version of RecordKit.
