# The Nonstrict website

## Development

Run the website locally with `./serve.sh` from the project folder, the website will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you make changes you can just run the package either from Xcode with the run button or from the commandline with `swift run`. This will build a fresh version of the site that will be served by the above script.

To develop, open `Package.swift` with a recent version of Xcode, edit code and run
