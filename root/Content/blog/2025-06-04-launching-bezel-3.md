Bezel is our macOS app that mirrors any iPhone on your Mac by just plugging it in. Bezel makes it quick and easy to present, record and demo any app. Bezel also looks beautiful with high resolution, super accurate device frames that match the connected iPhones color.

### Take it Full Screen

With version 3.0 launched today we introduce full screen mirroring. Get rid of all the clutter of your desktop and present your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV without distractions.

### A Localized Welcome

Another new addition is the new Welcome screen you will land on, it gives you a great overview of your devices and clear options to connect a new device. We also translated the whole app to 9 languages to make it easier to use for non-English speaking users.

### Updated App Icon

With this major release we also have a great new app icon designed by [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com/). We're really happy to have this new icon that captures the main iPhone mirroring feature of Bezel perfectly.

### Other improvements

This release also has a lot of smaller improvements and fixes, such as the onboarding flow that has been improved. It's fully tailored and optimize to help you connect to Apple TVs and Apple Vision Pro and mentions the device name when known to make it more clear what device we're looking for. We also made great stability improvements and little UI improvements.
