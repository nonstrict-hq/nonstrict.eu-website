Wireless mirroring is something we've wanted to build for a long, long time. It wasn't easy to get right, but it was awesome to build and we're really happy it's finally out there.

You can now walk around the room during a presentation, stand in front of a big screen, or pass the device around while everyone still sees what's happening. Wireless mirroring supports real-time video, screenshots, and full screen mode. Recording and audio support are coming in a future update.

### How to use it

Open Bezel, click "Connect an iPhone" and choose the wireless option. We'll guide you through the setup. Once configured, your Mac appears as an AirPlay destination. From your iPhone, swipe to Control Center, tap Screen Mirroring, and select Bezel. Your device appears on your Mac instantly.

### Bezel vs iPhone Mirroring

With Apple's iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia, more people than ever know that mirroring is possible. With Apple's solution primarily designed for quickly interacting with your own iPhone without picking it up. Bezel is built for presenting and sharing:

- **Works with any device** — Mirror iPhones and iPads that aren't signed into your iCloud account
- **Your iPhone keeps working** — Your device doesn't lock up while mirroring
- **Presentation-ready** — Full screen mode, beautiful bezels, recording, and screenshots
- **iPad support** — iPhone Mirroring doesn't support iPads, Bezel does
